    "content": "The Western Electric 161A is a very rare piece of telephone\/payphone history.  It marks a major point of transition of the payphone when it came to the Bell System.  The 161A is part of the first series of pay stations that was made by Western Electric.  It is very interesting to study how for many years they built on the 161 series making changes and improvements that went into subsequent models, all the way until the 1960s.\n<br><br>\nThe 161A was made by Western Electric once they broke away from Gray after Gray's patents ran out.  The 161A was built in the image of the Gray 150G.  The main difference is that the phone is completely made from Western Electric parts.  On the inside it looks very much like a 150G.  The chute on the inside of the upper housing is styled differently from Grays.  On the outside note the Western Electric Company Inc. inscription on the lower housing above the vault door, the Gray 150G would have had an inscription for both the Gray and Western Electric companies both of which had parts in the machine.  The back of the pay station also looks very different from the Gray.  The back plate of the Gray is cast iron and has a couple vertical ribs that go from the top the the bottom to help strengthen it.  The back plate of the Western Electric (161A) is made of steel and has 4 vertical and several diagonal ribs to add strength.  In fact all the housing parts of the Western Electric 161A are made of steel.  The coin gauge is stamped stainless steel, the Gray would have had a molded bronze one.\n<br><br>\n\nThe Western Electric 161A, is a 5 cent automatic prepay pay station.  This is it takes a minimum of 5 cents to make any kind of a call including a call to the operator.  It is automatic because you can make a call without the need for an operator, it has a dial.  It is pre-pay because you have to put a coin in before you can make a call.  The 161A is wired for anti-side-tone, note the connection for a black wire along with the red yellow and green on the wood terminal strip, similar to the black lead on a 202 or 151AL candlestick phone that goes to the subset.",

Place the T key in the slot on the left side of the phone and then place the upper housing key in the lock on the right side of the phone and turn the key clockwise (this will release the locking rails inside the upper housing).  Turn the T key about 1\/3 turn counterclockwise, you will hear the rails drop.  Slide the upper housing using a wiggling motion towards you.  The upper housing runs through 2 channels on the main housing. Take a look at the lower edges of the upper housing as you pull it part way open.  Before the housing is all the way off, reach into the opening on the right side, you will see a wire that comes from the back of the upper housing and plugs into the chassis inside the phone, there is a finger loop on the plug to enable you to grasp it.  Support the upper housing with one hand (so it doesn\u2019t get pushed and fall, it is heavy) and reach in with the other hand and unplug the plug.  Then carefully pull the upper housing the rest of the way off and set it down.    <br><br>\nObserve how the line cord enters through the rear of the main housing and the 2 terminals it connects to inside the phone.  Loosen the screws on both terminals to release the wires and pull the cord out through the back of the phone.  <br><br>  Install the 178A mounting plate with the word TOP facing you and at the top of the board.  Secure it to the wall using at least four 2 inch long #10 wood screws utilizing any of the indented holes on the plate, all screws must go securely into studs or other solid wood structure.  For other materials (concrete, steel, sheetrock etc) use appropriate fasteners.  As you install the mounting plate channel the line cord that was removed earlier (or another cord or house wire if desired) up behind the mounting plate and through the oval shaped hole that lines up with the similar shaped hole on the back of the phone.  Be careful when installing the board that the wire doesn\u2019t get pinched between the plate and the wall.  Leave the wire with the terminals that connect inside the phone coming about 6 inches out of the hole in the plate.  <br><br>  Install the 4 security studs on the back of the phone. There are several holes on the back of the main housing but only 4 that are threaded which will accept the security studs.  Tighten them with a screwdriver.  Now, install the main housing onto the mounting plate.  Use caution, the phone is heavy.  While lifting and lining up the main housing with the mounting plate push the wire through the hole in the back of the phone, as you continue installing the main hosing onto the mounting plate make sure the wire has no slack in it, you want the wire to come straight out of the mounting plate and enter into the phone, and not to get pinched in between.  Line up the 4 security studs with the key hole shaped openings in the mounting plate and set them in, then slide the lower housing down in the holes to lock them in.  Be sure that all 4 security studs are locked into the mounting plate.  Reconnect the 2 wires previously removed to the same terminals they were removed from inside the phone.  Install the upper housing.  <br><br>  With the key still in the right side of the upper housing and the T key still in the open position, carefully lift the upper housing and plug the round plug at the back of the upper housing back into the socket inside the phone.  The plug is round and will only go in one way.  Line the upper housing up so that it\u2019s bottom edges (left and right) will line it up with the channels of the main housing and begin to slide it back while wiggling as necessary.  Before it gets all the way back, make sure the wire to the plug doesn\u2019t get caught between the housings. (Be careful to keep your fingers clear as not to catch them as the gap closes).  Latch the housing rails by turning the T key clockwise. If the upper housing isn\u2019t completely seated the T key won\u2019t turn all the way. Make sure, all 4 corners of the upper housing are pushed back all the way. Once the T key is turned to the locked position, turn the key on the right side counter clockwise and remove it. <br><br>  Using the T key remove the vault door, insert the T key into the slot in the center of the door and rotate it 1\/3 turn to the left, carefully remove the door, some wiggling may be necessary.  At the back of the vault area there are 4 holes where bolts can be screwed into the back plate, install the 2 locking bolts supplied in this kit into any (2) of the holes and tighten with a screwdriver. While the security studs will support the phone on the mounting plate, these screws will lock it on so that if the phone was lifted it couldn\u2019t come loose.  With the T key still inserted in the vault door in the unlocked position reinstall the door.  Some pressure will have to be put on the door pressing it towards the back of the phone, turn the T key to the right and remove it and the door is locked.\n<br><br>\nNotes:\n<br><br>\n\u2022\tSome older touch tone phones are polarity sensitive.  While I test all phones for operation I have no way of knowing if you line is correct or reversed.  If your phone gets dial tone but won\u2019t produce tones when the buttons are pressed the polarity is wrong.  By using the directions found in the installation portion remove the upper housing and disconnect the 2 (red and green) wires from the line cord and reverse them.  This should take care of the problem.  If you have access to the phone jack you can reverse the wires there instead which may be easier.  This is not an issue with rotary phones or my payphones that actually require coins to work.\n<br><br>\n\u2022\tOnce installed you may see a slightly uneven gap between the back of the phone and the mounting plate, this is normal.\n",

Actually it was 15 to 20 bangs.\n    <br><br>\n    My work associates managed to welcome me to the company, the Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania where I was to be a Coin Collector for the next two and a half years, taking the money out of every one of the thousands of pay telephones in the City of Philadelphia by participating in the first and likely the only multi-vehicle accident in Bell System history when about 15 to 20 phone company trucks collided while driving to a coffee shop first thing in the morning, contradicting prevailing company policy regarding going to coffee shops first thing in the morning.\n    <br><br>\n    The accident happened 50 years ago  that morning when the guy who was to teach me the ropes began fooling around while driving the 1964 Jeep Wagoneer the company used as an armored vehicle, with bars on the windows and an alarm, likely to impress me, an 18 year-old kid. But he got distracted and drove into the company truck in front of him. That guy ran into the truck in front of him, and so on and so on until all 15 to 20 trucks had collided with one another.

They simply waited for the armada of phone company managers to arrive and bury the entire affair in the annals of Bell System history and legend, dismissing the police and saving the disciplining and chastisement of these fine examples of the company's stable of defensive drivers for a future occurrence.

    "content": "A rare and beautiful model the Gray 75-A.  It was made by Gray for the Automatic Electric company.  This antique paystation is very early, one of the first made for the Strowger System.  It was probably made around the same time as the 50A or early 50G models.  The upper housing is cast iron with no dial cup cut in.  Mounted to the front is the \"shoe\" which houses the transmitter assembly as well as the dial.  The dial, transmitter and receiver are Automatic Electric.  The coin gauge is the early cast bronze type.  Note the small instruction card holder on the front of the phone!  The lock that holds the upper housing in place is a 10-E which utilizes a flat key.  The lower housing is steel with \"The Gray Telephone Paystation Company\" name on it but no second line with the place of manufacture like most models.  The vault door is an early flat stamped steel type with an 11A lock on it.  The door has a small tag riveted to it that is stamped with the same number as the key for the vault lock.  The backboard is cast iron, it has a long wood terminal strip attached to it.  The paystation is a 5 cent pre-pay model.  It  has an early Western Electric coin relay which functions to collect or return coins that were deposited into the chute.  Apparently Gray didn't produce coin relays for early paystations, probably because Western Electric held the patents.   See the article on the Gray 750 model, it is very similar but made up for post-pay service.",

It most likely started life as a 150K.  An early Gray handset hook replaced the one for the receiver and an AE 1A type handset was added.  Since the instruction card holder was used to cover the dial opening it wasn't available to cover the transmitter mounting holes, 3 slot less bolts fill them.  The removal of the transmitter from the front of the phone prompted the need to to add a signal transmitter to the inside.  It is attached to a bracket mounted to the coin chute.  This transmitter picks up the sounds of the coins being dropped as they hit the coin gong and bell for the operator's benefit.  The entire housing of the paystation is made of steel.  The coin gauge (slots) is the early bronze type.  The vault door lock is a 10L and the lock that attaches the upper housing is a E-10-E which uses a flat key.  Inside the vault area is an open top coin receptacle.  The phone is set up for manual operation meaning all the functions (collecting money and connecting calls) was handled by the operator.

    "content": "Mike\u2019s Vintage Payphone by Mike Davis In this article we are looking at the early version of the Gray\/Western Electric 50A. Unlike the second version depicted in my article Gray\/WE 50A #2 which has an early steel bottom this one has a completely made of cast iron body which includes the lower housing assembly.  The steel bottoms on the later models were stamped with the Gray and Western Electric names.  The cast iron bottom on this early model only has an indent above the door where a bronze tag is fastened on with 2 rivets.  The tag is cast with the two companies names.  These cast iron lower housings were very easily vandalized!  A good whack with a hammer would break it apart.  This model came out around 1912 and was produced for only a few years. <br><br>\n\n I'm sure no one back then would have thought that the 50A would have been the great granddad to so many models that came out and were produced up until around 1970.  Over the years after Gray made the 50A for Western Electric they went on to make many other models.  Based on that phone more models with many easily interchangeable parts were made by the Automatic Electric, Western Electric and Northern Electric companies. <br><br>\n\nThe 50A is a manual telephone which means the operator made the connection.  This model came out almost a decade before the dial was put into use, many 50As were converted for dial use later on in life and renamed 50G.  The phone is a pre-pay model.  This means that before a user could get an operator a coin had to be deposited.  A Western Electric coin relay assembly attached to a hopper carried out this function.   <br><br>\n\nThe receiver hook arm on the 50A is nickel plated, it is thinner than what was used on later models.  The one used later one was much thicker to prevent bending and breaking from vandalism and rough use.  The backboard is thin with no extra support at the mounting holes that are accessed through the vault area which could lead to cracking of the backboard.  These holes were beefed up in later models.  The transmitter is mounted by use of a Western Electric 8A mount screwed to the front of the phone, later models used a 10A mount attached from the inside which is much stronger and can not be removed from the outside.  The instruction card holder on the front of the phone is just the frame, it is nickel plated.  Unlike later models that have a dial cup in them the metal here is solid and flat, so no metal back plate is needed to cover a hole.  The 4 #2 screws that hold the frame on are thread right into the upper housing.  <br><br>\n\nThe 50A is a very rare and desirable model.  I am very happy that I am able to own both variations of this antique telephone.\n\n",

    "content": "Mike\u2019s Vintage Payphone by Mike Davis  In this article we are discussing ways to get into the lower compartment of a locked antique \"three slot payphone\".  Very often these payphones are found locked and without keys.  Opening the upper housing isn't a problem because there are only a few keys that are common to most models.  The vault door lock is a different story.  Every coin vault lock in every payphone has a key unique to it.   When a phone is found that doesn't have a key for the vault lock either leave it as is or replace the lock.  You will not be able to obtain a key for your lock.  The old lock is removed in most cases by disassembling the phone .  This isn't always easy, from my experience some are basically a piece of cake to do and others are near impossible.  I still have some phones that I still haven\u2019t been able to open up yet!  I know of some other methods people use but am just mentioning the procedures that I have used with much success and which cause minimal damage.<br><br>\n\n If there is still a mounting plate such as for example a 174A attached to the phone or if there is still a steel coin receptacle on the inside it is much more difficult.  Before you do anything take a small screwdriver and try turning the lock, there is always the possibility that someone in the past as already defeated it.   If there is a mounting plate attached you will need to remove it first.   By removing the upper housing from the phone you will be able to remove any bolts mounted through that area of the phone.  If the phone has a security (Ace, cylinder type) lock look in the back of the phone directly behind it for a large flat faced slotted screw head.  If there is one, unscrew it while removing the upper housing.   If you see other similar large screw heads (security studs) on the back of the mounting plate remove them as well.   Place the upper housing aside and remove any bolts that go from the inside of the phone through the backboard and into the mounting plate.  All that should be left  holding the mounting plate to the phone will be as many as 4 bolts that go through from the inside of the lower compartment into the backboard.  You will be able to see the ends of the bolts when looking from behind, you will have to drill them out.  Now the mounting plate has been separated from the telephone, place it aside.<br><br>\n\nOn later Western Electric & Northern Electric payphones all seven bolts that attach the lower housing to the backboard of the phone are accessible from the outside (rear).  Earlier models as well as AE and Gray payphones have 5 blots screwed in from the outside and 2 from the inside.  On a Western Electric phone with the 7 screws on the outside you can remove them and then carefully lift and pivot the backboard away from the lower housing.  Be careful there may be wires still connected between the backboard and the lower assembly.  If there is no steel coin receptacle inside  you can now unscrew the lock on the back of the door and remove the door.<br><br>\n\nOn payphones with the 5 screws on the outside and 2 coming through from the inside first determine if there is a metal coin receptacle on the inside by looking into the holes in the backboard with a small flashlight or by sticking  a screwdriver in.  If there is no coin receptacle use a long thin screwdriver to remove the 4 lock mounting screws.  Work through the 4 large holes in the backboard that the mounting bolts go through.  You can insert the screwdriver while peering through and shining a small flashlight.  Once all of the screws are removed from the lock stand the phone up, let the lock drop and remove the door.  <br><br>\n\nNow, if your phone has the 2 bolts coming from the inside out and there is a steel coin receptacle on the inside you will have to remove the backboard first.   This comes with different degrees of difficulty and not always success depending on things such as rust contamination , over tightened  bolts are and how hard the steel is that the bolts are made of.  What has to be done is the 2 bolts have to be backed off back into the phone.   First I use a sharp punch and poke it into the end of the bolt and try to screw it in.  This has worked for me a couple times when the bolts weren\u2019t very tight.  There are a couple other methods that I have used when the punch method doesn\u2019t work.  One is to use a rotary tool to cut a slot into the end of the bolt and then use a thin screwdriver to drive the bolt back into the phone.  Another is to drill a small hole into the end of each of the bolts being very carefully to center it.   Don\u2019t drill all the way through the bolt, just a quarter inch or so.  Next with a larger bit, still smaller than the diameter of the bolt and go very slow into the same hole, the bit should catch the bolt and slowly turn it clockwise, continue slowly and screw the bolt backward into the phone.  Once the 2 bolts are backed into the phone remove the 5 screws accessible from the back and carefully pivot the backboard away from the lower housing.  Be careful not to break any wires between the backboard and the lower housing.   As  I mentioned earlier depending on certain conditions these methods may or may not work, they are the best chance of getting into the phone without damaging it that I know of.<br><br>\n\nIf you have a phone with a steel coin receptacle in it and once you have the backboard separated from the lower housing you will need to get the coin receptacle out in order to access the backside of the vault door!  If the receptacle doesn\u2019t have a lid on it you may be able to very carefully work it out through the back of the lower housing.  If there is a lid there is no easy way it will come out.  There are 2 possible ways to get it out now.   One, which is usually what I choose to do is to cut and crush the box with a hammer and chisel, it is a lot of work but I get it out without damaging the phone.  The other is to remove all the screws that hold the tray on the top of the lower housing (using a similar method to removing the 2 screws between the lower housing and the backboard that we discussed earlier).   It  is very difficult to do without damaging the tray. Then lift the tray while working the coin receptacle out of the lower housing.   Once the coin  receptacle is removed the lock can be unscrewed from the back of the vault door and the door can be removed. \n\n",

    "content": "Mike\u2019s Vintage Payphone   by Mike Davis\n\nIn this article I am writing about what is not the oldest but probably the rarest payphone in my collection.  It is what I call the second version of the Gray\/Western Electric 50A.  Unlike the first version with a body totally made of \u201cbrittle\u201d cast iron this version has a steel lower housing.  The steel housing was a stronger, more secure place to store the telephone companies money.  The first version came out around 1912 and this version came out in the mid teens.   (Both versions can be seen on my website.)  The 50G and all later models have steel lower housings.  The lower housing on this particular version of the 50A is unique.  On the front above the vault door it is marked \u201cThe Gray Telephone Paystation Company and Western Electric Company Makers\u201d, on all later lower housings the word Inc. is added \u201cThe Gray Telephone Paystation Company and Western Electric Company Inc. Makers\u201d.  \n\nThe 50A is the first of this type of paystation, it was the predecessor to all the models from the 50G through the 1234G (for Western Electric, not to mention all the models made by Automatic Electric and Northern Electric).  One of my main interests in collection payphones is being able to observe the progression from the beginning to the end of the 3 slot!  One thing that makes the 50A unique is the fact that the upper housing has no dial cup.  If you remove the frame and card the front of the phone is just flat.  The 50A came out almost a decade before the common dial was in use.  It is a manual, prepay machine.   The user would have dropped a coin into the proper slot to get a connection to the operator who would have connected the call.  All that was needed to make the connection was 5 cents.  The operator had control over the coin held in escrow by the relay, she could collect or return the coin.\n\nThis phone has a very early version of the 2 coil relay installed.  I am not aware of any others like it being in collections.  The vault door is flat steel, the lock is an early Corbin 11A with a grooved key.  The upper housing as well as the backboard are cast iron, the upper housing lock is a E-10-E with a flat key.  Unlike models setup for a dial there are only 2 contacts (for the transmitter) between the upper housing and the backboard that make contact when it is all together and locked.  The coin box is a 1A with a  1C self locking lid.  The 1A coin box is an early version with flat sides.  The receiver hook is thinner than the one used on later models and is nickel plated.  The instruction card holder or frame on the front is screwed right into the upper housing, there is no back plate since there is no dial opening to cover up.  The frame is nickel plated, the card in the frame is original to the phone.  It came from Mount Vernon NY.  The transmitter is mounted by use of a Western Electric mount screwed to the front of the phone, later models used a 10A mount attached from the inside.

The 62 is an automatic (dial) prepay machine (meaning a coin would have to be deposited before a call could be made).  The 62 was made rather late in the game for Gray.  After Automatic Electric took them over they picked up at the same place and produced type 62s as well as some other models Gray was making at the time.  All the housing parts are made of stamped steel.  The handset 62 has the earlier bronze coin gauge and the 2 piece one has a stamped stainless steel gauge.  Both paystations have Automatic Electric dials, both have nice porcelain \u201cdaisy\u201d dial faces, the 2 piece one has a pot metal shroud, the handset one has a Bakelite shroud.  These dial shrouds and porcelains while at a quick glance look similar to those found on Western Electric 3 slot paystatoins they are completely different.  Due to space constraints I am limited to how many pictures I can include here so if you would like to see more of these two phones or any others in my collection please visit my site at mvtelonline.com.\n",

The #7 has a transmitter arm similar to the WE #5, the base of which is molded right into the cast iron.  The single wire that connects to the transmitter is located outside of the arm, there is one eyelet near the transmitter to support it.   The collector has very basic lead chutes that using gravity to bring the coins from the slots down to where they hit and bounce off of bells and a gong.  They then fall to the coin drawer at the bottom.  A nickel and a dime when dropped hit bells of different tones, a quarter hits a cathedral gong which makes a different sound.  When the operator was on the line she could tell what coins were dropped by the different sounds.  There is even a coin return chute to return coins that were dropped into the wrong slot.  There was no other method for returning coins once they were dropped.  The calling instructions above the transmitter arm are cast right onto the housing.  In the front of this type #7 there is a 3\/8 inch hole right in the area of the coin drawer.  This hole is used for mounting the collector to the phone.  Unlike later collectors the coin drawer opens to the right not to the front.  When the drawer is removed access is given to a mounting hole that goes through the rear of the housing.  To install the collector a bracket is screwed to the front of the phone.  A hook at the top of the collector fits into the bracket which allows it to hang from the phone.  Then 1 screw is installed through the back of the #7s case and into the phone securing it in place.  The screwdriver goes through the hole in the front of the collector which is in perfect line with the screw being tightened.  Once that is done the coin drawer can be installed.",
