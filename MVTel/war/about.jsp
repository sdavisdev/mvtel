    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p> 
        I collect and restore antique telephones.<br/><br/>
        While I do have many different types and ages of phones in my collection
        my main focus is on Payphones, Pay Stations and Coin Collectors.
        I have had an interest in telephones since I was a kid. I started
        collecting them around 1990 and at that time joined the telephone 
        collecting clubs. I found them to be a great resource not only for
        finding phones, parts and information but also for making friends.
        I have attended dozens of &quot;Phone Shows&quot; as well as hosted two.
        I have served on the ATCA Board for many years.
